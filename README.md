This was done by me as part of DevOps evaluation Project.
# Scenario
There is a requirement to be able to convert an integer into words. For example, 57 needs to be converted into “fifty seven”.
The objective of this project is to develop a method which can convert the numbers 1 through 999 to words. If you have time extend the range up to 2 billion. The method needs to be developed using Test Driven Development (TDD). A standalone application is also required which reads a number from the keyboard and prints out its value in words or “Invalid number”. The program should exit when the user enters 0.
The application needs to be packaged as an executable jar file using Ant.
# Deliverables
 The unit test java file
 The number to words Java file
 The main application Java file
 The test results file from the report directory
 A screen shot of the application output after running it with a representative set of numbers
